# Sociofy
Link to the deployed website : https://manit-sociofy.netlify.app/
In this project, I have developed a web-based social media application using ReactJS and Node.js, with MySQL as the database. The application allows users to perform various social media functionalities such as posting images with descriptions, liking and commenting on other people's posts, creating a profile, and following other users.

Sociofy includes user authentication functionality, allowing new users to register before gaining access to the platform. Once registered, users can log in using their credentials to access the full features of the application.

Upon logging in, users are directed to the home page where they can view all the posts from various users. The home page displays posts along with their respective images, descriptions, likes, comments, and other relevant information. Users can interact with these posts by liking, commenting, and viewing the comments made by others.

To contribute to the social media platform, users can create their own posts with images. These posts are then visible to their followers, allowing for a personalized feed experience. Users can update their posts by editing the descriptions or deleting them if needed.

By clicking on a user's profile, other users can access a dedicated page displaying all the posts that user has shared. This page provides the option to delete specific posts, giving users control over the content they have posted. Additionally, users have the ability to delete their own comments, allowing them to manage their interactions within the platform.

Furthermore, users have the option to update their profile information. This includes uploading a profile picture and cover picture, as well as adding or modifying their address and other relevant details. These updates contribute to personalizing the user's profile and enhancing their online presence.

One notable feature of the application is the implementation of a dark mode functionality. This allows users to switch between a light and dark color scheme, enhancing the user experience and providing a personalized interface.

Overall, this social media application provides a comprehensive set of features, including user authentication, post viewing, liking, commenting, post creation, post deletion, comment deletion, and profile updates. These functionalities create an engaging and interactive platform for users to connect, share content, and manage their online presence.

To create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, I utilized ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS helped me create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application's state. It allowed me to interact with the correct elements of the webpage and update the UI based on user actions.

The backend of the application was developed using Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js enabled me to build the server-side logic, handle HTTP requests, and communicate with the MySQL database. With Node.js, I could create an efficient and scalable backend for the social media application.

MySQL was used as the database management system to store and retrieve data. It provided a robust and structured approach to manage user information, posts, likes, comments, and other relevant data for the application. MySQL allowed me to perform efficient data operations, including storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

Here are the tables which I have created in the database :

Throughout the development process, I followed industry best practices for code organization, security, and performance optimization. I also implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users could access certain features and data.

Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in ReactJS, Node.js, and MySQL, as well as my ability to develop a complex web-based application with rich user interactions and a visually appealing interface.
