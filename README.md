# Sociofy
In this project, I have developed a web-based social media application using ReactJS and Node.js, with MySQL as the database. The application allows users to perform various social media functionalities such as posting images with descriptions, liking and commenting on other people's posts, creating a profile, and following other users.

To create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, I utilized ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS helped me create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application's state. It allowed me to interact with the correct elements of the webpage and update the UI based on user actions.

The backend of the application was developed using Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js enabled me to build the server-side logic, handle HTTP requests, and communicate with the MySQL database. With Node.js, I could create an efficient and scalable backend for the social media application.

MySQL was used as the database management system to store and retrieve data. It provided a robust and structured approach to manage user information, posts, likes, comments, and other relevant data for the application. MySQL allowed me to perform efficient data operations, including storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

One notable feature of the application is the implementation of a dark mode functionality. This allows users to switch between a light and dark color scheme, enhancing the user experience and providing a personalized interface.

Throughout the development process, I followed industry best practices for code organization, security, and performance optimization. I also implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users could access certain features and data.

Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in ReactJS, Node.js, and MySQL, as well as my ability to develop a complex web-based application with rich user interactions and a visually appealing interface.
